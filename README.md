# Taxi-For-Hire-Vehicle-Trip

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is for you to:
• Increase your proficiency in C programming, your dexterity with dynamic memory allocation
and your understanding of linked data structures, through programming a dictionary.
• Increase your understanding of how computational complexity can affect the performance of an
algorithm by conducting orderly experiments with your program and comparing the results of
your experimentation with theory.
• Increase your proficiency in using UNIX utilities.

## Background
A dictionary is an abstract data type that stores and supports lookup of key, value pairs. For example,
in a telephone directory, the (string) key is a person or company name, and the value is the phone
number. In a student record lookup, the key would be a student ID number and the value would be a
complex structure containing all the other information about the student.
A dictionary can be implemented in C using a number of underlying data structures. Any implementation
must support the operations: makedict a new dictionary; insert a new item (key, value
pair) into a dictionary; search for a key in the dictionary, and return the associated value. Most
dictionaries will also support the operation delete an item.

## Task
In this assignment, you will create a simple instance of a dictionary, and we’ll use it to look up information
about for-hire vehicle trips in New York City.
